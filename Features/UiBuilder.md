# UI Builder

If you want to use the recent Unity UI builder, here's a [nice tutorial about it](https://gamedev-resources.com/create-an-in-game-inventory-ui-with-ui-toolkit/). The main steps are:   
- In versions earlier than 2021, install `UI Builder` in the `Package Manager` (from packages `Unity Registry`)
  - There is a bug that might cause many errors to appear in the console when playing a scene; if so, restart Unity
- Open `Window`, `UI Toolkit`, `UI Builder`
- Design your UI, and don't hesitate to `extract inline styles to new class` to help maintainability
