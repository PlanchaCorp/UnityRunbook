# Project guidelines

## File names

We use **PascalCase** for every Unity files (and folders)  
*Ex: CrabMovement.cs, CrabDigging.png, Crab.prefab*  

Try to find relevant names! Other people must be able to understand the purpose of your files by their names.  

## Project file structure

We try to be consistent with where we put our files.  
Here is a good enough file structure we can use:  

* **Assets**
  * **GameData**: *All instantiated scriptable objects (but not the classes!)*
  * **Graphics**: *Everything about graphical assets*
    * **Animations**
    * **Textures**
    * **Tiles**
  * **Prefabs**
  * **Scenes**
  * **ScriptableObjects**: *Only the classes*
  * **Scripts**: *Structure the content of Scripts as best as you can*
